X/O Game

This is a simple X/O game simulation in Python. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the grid.

Gameplay

The game starts with an empty grid, and players take turns placing their marks on the grid. The game continues until one player wins or the grid is full.

Functions

The game has several functions:

korsatish: Displays the current state of the grid.
yurish_kiritish: Allows players to input their mark and position on the grid.
yutish: Checks if a player has won the game.
Running the Game

To run the game, simply execute the code in a Python interpreter or save it to a file and run it using python. The game will start, and you can play by inputting your mark and position on the grid. The game will end when one player wins or the grid is full.

Game Logic

The game logic is implemented in the Oyin class, which represents the game itself. The korsatish function displays the current state of the grid, and the yurish_kiritish function allows players to input their mark and position on the grid. The yutish function checks if a player has won the game.
